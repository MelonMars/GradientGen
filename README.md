# GradientGen

[GradientGen](https://gray-aridatha-42.tiiny.site/)

This is a simple web app that is able to create nice gradients using shaders in GLSL, that morph over time, allowing the user to create and place "blobs" of colors, and then modify their vibrancy, size, &c, and also modify how the different blobs are combined. The UI is relatively straightforward.
